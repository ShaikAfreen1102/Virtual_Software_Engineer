# Virtual Software Engineer (VSE)

Virtual Software Engineer (VSE) is a role-based learning and simulation platform
designed for final-year engineering students and freshers to experience
real-world software development workflows without internships.

The platform simulates how engineers work in real companies by guiding users
through the complete Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) using tasks,
visual learning, time-bound phases, quizzes, and certification.

## 🚀 Key Features

- Role-based software engineering simulation
- Complete SDLC experience (Requirement → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment)
- Beginner-friendly explanations with simple language
- Visual learning using videos and fallback images/diagrams
- Time-controlled learning phases (cannot skip content)
- Mandatory quiz validation before certification
- Auto-generated professional certificate with verification ID
- Downloadable PDF certificate and digital VSE badge
- Privacy-first and secure-by-design platform

## 👨‍💻 Roles Available

Users can choose and experience real industry roles such as:
- Frontend Developer
- Backend Developer
- Software Tester (QA)
- DevOps Engineer

Each role contains role-specific tasks, visuals, explanations, and assessments.

## 📚 Learning Rules & Validation

To maintain learning integrity, the platform enforces strict rules:

- Users must spend the required minimum time on each learning phase
- Tasks unlock sequentially (no skipping allowed)
- Videos are supported with image-based visual fallbacks
- A mandatory quiz of 10 MCQs must be completed after task completion
- Only 3 incorrect answers are allowed
- Certificate download is enabled only after passing the quiz

This ensures users genuinely learn instead of rushing to certification.

## 🎓 Certification

After successful completion:
- Users receive a professional VSE certificate
- Certificate includes:
  - Role completed
  - Issue date
  - Unique verification ID
- Users can download:
  - PDF certificate

## 🔐 Privacy & Security

VSE is built with a privacy-first approach:

- Only minimal user data is collected (name, email, role)
- No unnecessary personal information is stored
- No third-party data sharing
- Secure handling of user sessions
- Educational-use-only data processing
- Transparent privacy and security practices

User trust and data safety are treated as a priority.
